# Head of Data - School Project

## Overview
Final Data course project including data science, webscraping, dataviz (python), SQL and BI viz.

## Path to all the projects
in /notebooks
I have made datascience + analysis project.

in /exercises
I have created all the webscrapping python files (I prefer python over Jupyter Notebooks that is why). The results have all been extracted as CSVs under /data/results.

in /sql
I have created all the sequel files.

BI dashboard is under this link [here](https://lookerstudio.google.com/reporting/0c849da7-9b18-4844-b1f7-3600c978cc4f)
